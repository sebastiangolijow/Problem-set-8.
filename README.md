# Problem-set-8.
Complete the implementation of register in such a way that it allows a user to register for an account via a form.  Require that a user input a username, implemented as a text field whose name is username. Render an apology if the user’s input is blank or the username already exists. Require that a user input a password, implemented as a text field whose name is password, and then that same password again, implemented as a text field whose name is confirmation. Render an apology if either input is blank or the passwords do not match. Submit the user’s input via POST to /register. INSERT the new user into users, storing a hash of the user’s password, not the password itself. Hash the user’s password with generate_password_hash Odds are you’ll want to create a new template (e.g., register.html) that’s quite similar to login.html.
